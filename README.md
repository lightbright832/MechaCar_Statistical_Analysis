## Overview of Analysis
### Purpose:
Car manufacturers like AutosRUs' occasionally hit roadblocks in their production of new cars. With any product launch there are going to be times when a prototype must be tweaked. This is the case with the new MechaCar that AutosRUs' has recently designed. Due to the snags in production it is necessary to run a regression analysis to identify any deviations from the intended specifications. The linear regression model is being used to predict the mpg achieved by the MechaCar prototype. 

## Linear Regression Analysis

* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  The variables/coefficients that provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset were Intercept, vehicle length, and ground clearance.
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  We know that the slope of this linear model is not zero because the results do not create a horizontal line when graphed. Therefore, it is not possible to have a zero   slope.
* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  The linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the p value is only 5.35e-11. If the p-value were higher than the linear model would not     be considered effective. 
  ## Summary Statistics on Suspension

  * The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the       current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?   
    The current manufacturing data does meet the desing specifications for Lot 1 and Lot 2. The variance for these two lots is not more than 100 pounds. However, Lot 3       shows that the variance is 170. This falls outside of the expected specifications.
